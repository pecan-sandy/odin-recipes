            <h3>Description</h3>
                This is my grandma's best lasagna recipe, except I use sour cream instead of ricotta (a trick I picked <br>up from my mother-in-law). She always made it for birthdays and special occasions. This makes a large <br>amount, so I halve it when making it for my boyfriend and myself. It's very cheesy, so sometimes I add <br>a little extra tomato sauce.

                    <li>½ pound ground beef</li>

                    <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                    <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
                    <li>1 (8 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
                    <li>1 (16 ounce) container sour cream</li>
                    <li>2 (12 ounce) packages shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
                    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>½ cup chopped pitted green olives</li>
                    <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
                    <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally,<br> until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain any excess grease. </li>
                    <li>Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, and sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat,<br> then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes. </li>
                    <li>When the sauce has simmered for about 15 minutes, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.<br> Add lasagna noodles and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about<br> 8 minutes. Drain. </li>
                    <li>Stir sour cream, 1/2 of the mozzarella, Parmesan, olives, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. </li>
                    <li>Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce evenly over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking<br> dish. Cover with 1/3 of the lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce, and 1/3 of the cheese<br> mixture; repeat layers two more times with remaining noodles, sauce, and cheese mixture. Sprinkle<br> remaining mozzarella evenly over top. </li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the cheese is golden brown, about 30 minutes. </li>
                </ol>
